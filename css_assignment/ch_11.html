        <h3>Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
        <p>
            The <em>artificial intelligence </em>program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <em>Python, Numpy, Pandas,Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</em>, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, andending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3>Blockchain:</h3>
        <p>The main emphasis of <em>Blockchain </em>program is to understand the blockchains like <em>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric)</em>, and learn to program in languages such as  Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps(DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>
